# elevator-kata
the Lift kata done in python

These are some features. They can be implemented in any order you prefer.

- [x] an elevator responds to calls containing a source floor and direction
- [x] an elevator delivers passengers to requested floors
- [x] an elevator doesn't respond immediately. consider options to simulate time
- [x] elevator calls are queued not necessarily FIFO
- [x] you may test a sequence of events happening when passengers use the elevator 
- [ ] you may implement current floor monitor
- [ ] you may implement direction arrows
- [ ] you may implement doors (opening and closing)
- [ ] you may implement DING!
- [ ] there can be more than one elevator

## Some clarifications
Implemented only the case when the controlling buttons are inside of the elevator - once you pressed the button, it stays on until the floor is reached

## Plans
Introduce elevator control system (multiple elevators, buttons with up/down button)
